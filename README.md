 3D Acoustic Room Modes Analysis: A Jupyter notebook implementing a Finite Element Method (FEM) solver in Mathematica for calculating and visualizing the acoustic modes of a room based on a 3D model. It provides detailed insights into the acoustic properties of the room such as mode frequencies, energies, decay times, and maximum amplitudes.
